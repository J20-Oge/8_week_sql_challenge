## Business Task :ramen:

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite.

## Case Study Questions 
-- 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

-- 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

-- 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

-- 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

-- 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?

-- 6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

-- 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?

-- 8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

-- 9.  If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?

-- 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?


## Dashboard
I assumed that Danny might need a dashboard to help him gain insight on the performance of his business and help him understand his customers better. 
So, I created a simple dashboard in PowerBI that could automatically update at the end of every month. 
To make the most of the dashboard, I will suggest to Danny to collect some more info from members and add more wonderful meals to his menu. 

Have a look
