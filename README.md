# 8 Week SQL Challenge

Hi, I am currently taking part in Danny Ma's 8 week SQL challenge. This repository contains the solution for the 8 case studies in #8WeekSQLChallenge!
I used MySql to answer all the questions. 

You can follow these steps to set up the schema on your desktop in Mysql:
1. Copy the Insert_queries file and paste in your sql script 
2. Run the code and voila! you've got your schema 

Now thats out of the way, you can start answering the questions from the case study. Enjoy the SQL journey with some of my solutions. 

Statisticaly yours,

Oge
